# Orthology Detector Deep Learning Algorithm

This project aims to defining a query protein sequence orthology category, with increased calculation spead and accuracy. We use Deep Learning approach. Training and Test are done on OMA orthology data set for viridiplantae subgroup.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to download from [OMA](https://omabrowser.org/oma/current/)

```
Oma protein sequences: 

https://omabrowser.org/All/oma-seqs.fa.gz

Oma orthology pairs:

https://omabrowser.org/All/oma-pairs.txt.gz
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
